# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
The projects in this repository illustrate my skillset in EDA, data visualization, and statistics.


## Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

This repository showcases projects I have completed that utilize various **exploratory data analysis techniques**. These projects highlight my ability to use python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for statistical analysis of data.

### **Data Analysis Tools Used**
1. **Univariate Analysis**
2. **Multivariate Analysis**

---

### **Statistical Plots Used**
- **Histogram with Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)**: Kernel Density Estimate on histograms show the probability density of continuous variables
- **BoxPlot**: Shows the distribution of the data and visualizes 1st Quartile, Median, and 3rd Quartile of the variable in both univariate and multivariate analysis
- **Countplot**: Used to visualize counts of nominal variables
- **Point Plot**: Illustrates the trend and and central tendency of variables

### **Project Overview**
#### 1. **Foodhub Analysis**
The first project in this repository is a project from MIT's **Data Science and Machine Learning Program**. The scenario was a food aggregator company wanting to better understand their customers in order to enhance customer experience. The data was provided to me, and after a through analysis of the data using techniques and plots listed above, I made the recommendation that the food aggregator should promote specific restuarants to their customers, based on the restaurants that brought in the most revenue. 

The project includes:
- Raw data
- Preprocessed and analyzed data
- Observations and final recommendations

**Details of this project can be found in the** [Food_Hub_Project folder](https://github.com/Garlid/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/main/Food_Hub_Project).

### **Future Additions**
I plan to expand this repository with EDA projects to showcase my ability to use python libraries and statistical analysis techniques to make data-backed recommendations.
