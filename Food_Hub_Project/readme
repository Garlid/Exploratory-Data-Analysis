# Food_Hub_Project Overview
The scenario for this project was a food aggregator company wanting to better understand their customers to enhance customer experience. Of course, by enhancing customer experience the company also increases revenue. 
The data was provided to me in a CSV file. Using Google Colab, I performed EDA on the data and provided observations, conclusions, and recommendations for the food aggregator.

### **EDA Steps**
1. **Import Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
2. **Mount Data From Google Drive**
2. **Observe Data Structure & Data Types**
2. **Observe Data Structure**
2. **Multivariate Analysis**

### **Data Analysis Tools Used**
1. **Univariate Analysis**
2. **Multivariate Analysis**

### **Statistical Plots Used**
- **Histogram with Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)**: Kernel Density Estimate on histograms show the probability density of continuous variables
- **BoxPlot**: Shows the distribution of the data and visualizes 1st Quartile, Median, and 3rd Quartile of the variable in both univariate and multivariate analysis
- **Countplot**: Used to visualize counts of nominal variables
- **Point Plot**: Illustrates the trend and and central tendency of variables

### **Project Overview**
#### 1. **Foodhub Analysis**
The first project in this repository is a project from MIT's **Data Science and Machine Learning Program**. The scenario was a food aggregator company wanting to better understand their customers in order to enhance customer experience. The data was provided to me, and after a through analysis of the data using techniques and plots listed above, I made the recommendation that the food aggregator should promote specific restuarants to their customers, based on the restaurants that brought in the most revenue. 

The project includes:
- Raw data
- Preprocessed and analyzed data
- Observations and final recommendations

**Details of this project can be found in the** [Food_Hub_Project folder](https://github.com/Garlid/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/tree/main/Food_Hub_Project).

### **Future Additions**
I plan to expand this repository with EDA projects to showcase my ability to use python libraries and statistical analysis techniques to make data-backed recommendations.
