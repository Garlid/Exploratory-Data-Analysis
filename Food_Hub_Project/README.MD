# Food_Hub_Project Overview
The scenario for this project was a food aggregator company wanting to better understand their customers to enhance customer experience. Of course, by enhancing customer experience the company also increases revenue. 
The data was provided to me in a CSV file. Using Google Colab, I performed EDA on the data and provided observations, conclusions, and recommendations for the food aggregator.

4. **Observe Data Structure**
5. **Univariate Analysis**
  - Histogram with KDE
  - Boxplot
  - Countplot
6. **Multivariate Analysis**
  - Boxplot
  - Pointplot
  - Heatmap
7. **Scenario-based Calculations**
  - ie, If the company charges restaurants x, what will revenue be?
8. **Conclusions**
9. **Recommendations**

### **Conclusions & Recommendations**
1. **Conclusions:** 
   - The most purchased cuisine type was American  
   - The most popular restaurant is the Shake Shack  
     *Revenue: $3,579.53*  
   - The second most popular restaurant was the Meatball Shop  
     *Revenue: $2,145.21*

2. **Recommendations**
   - The company should provide a promotional offer in the advertisement of restaurants like Shake Shack, The Meatball Shop, Blue Ribbon Sushi, and Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken  
   - Since the company earns 25% from orders of $20 or more, it could promote more expensive items from the menus of these restaurants  
   - Focus promotional efforts on American cuisine and restaurants with ratings between 4â€“5
